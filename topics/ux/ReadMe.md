# Intro to UX

UX (or *U*ser e*X*perience) is fundamentally about giving the user a pleasant experience when interacting with your application. Often times, this means emphasizing the usability of your site, particularly where it includes interactive or functional components. It also includes addressing other issues such as simplifying navigation, creating an intuitive user interface, and effectively meeting the users needs and expectations. One thing is for certain - at the center of UX is the *user*.

## UX Data-Driven Applications

A data-driven application is simply a program that is supported by a database for back-end storage of information. Storing and retrieving information with a database is all about CRUD \- making sure that way we handle information in storage will ensure the general integrity of the data (i.e.: that normal accessing of the data will not inadvertantly corrupt it). But how information is packaged for storage is entirely different from how it is unpacked and used in normal activities.

When building data-driven applications, it's important to consider how the data is going to be *displayed to* and *used by* the end-user. Remember, the database is designed to work well for data storage, not presentation. It's not unusual for the *shape* or structure of the data to appear differently in a user interface than how it is structured for data storage.
